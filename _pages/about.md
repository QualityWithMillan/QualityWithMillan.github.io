Welcome to **#QualityWithMillan** ( to be read as: hash tag quality with millan)! My name is **{{site.author.name}}** and I am the writer and creator of this space.

I started this blog as a way to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on a variety of topics that interest me. 
From personal software engineer, quality, testing, growth and self-improvement to travel and photography, I aim to cover a range of subjects that I hope will inspire and engage my readers.

I believe that we are all constantly learning and growing, and that sharing our knowledge and experiences can help us connect with others and make a positive impact on the world. That's why I started this blog - to share my stories and insights with you, and to hopefully inspire some meaningful conversations and connections along the way.

Thank you for visiting my blog and for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I hope you enjoy reading my posts and that you will come back to visit again soon.


Thanks ðŸ™Œ to you for reading _About_ page,
