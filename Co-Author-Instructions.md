### Step to contribute 🪜


1. Fork this repository with your GitHub account
    1. If you don't have GitHub account, continue reading...
1.  Create a markdown file (`.md extension`) and put your content in it. All markdown heading, bold, italic, links, `code` formatting are acceptable.
    1. You can use any IDE to preview your content, or
    1. Use one of the online readme editor or [search one on google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+readme+editor) to preview your content before sending.
1.  Make sure your post is submitted <ins>**without a date**</ins> in your file name.
    1. So that it looks something like this `my-first-blog-on-christmas.md` (all words in small case, separated by hiphens `-` . No `space` or special characters please)
    1. Once it's reviewed, I will add a date in front of it like this `2022-12-25-my-first-blog-on-christmas.md` ( YYYY-MM-DD) + `your-file-name.md`.
1.  You can associate your blog with a category 
    1. Make sure to pick **only one** categorie, looking at the published [Categories page](https://qualitywithmillan.github.io/categories/)
    1. You can add a new category if none of thsese suits your work:  `blog` , `post`, `tutorial`, `adventure`, `travel` etc.. 
1.  You can put multiple `tags`to your post, ideally limit them from 3 to 5 for better reader experience.
    1. You can have a look at [all published tags here](https://qualitywithmillan.github.io/tags/)
1. if you want to run locally follow instructions [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/docs-2-2/) or run `bundle install` followed by `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

if you see some errors :
- Remove `Gemfile.lock`
- run `bundle add webrick` [ It seems that in the latest version of ruby that is installed with homebrew webrick is not included by default. ]
- run `bundle`
and again `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

1. Once done raise a PR to `prod` branch, or send me the document(s).

I will ( or you can ) add **Author** details about yourself in [authors.yml file](https://github.com/QualityWithMillan/qualitywithmillan.github.io/blob/prod/_data/authors.yml)
