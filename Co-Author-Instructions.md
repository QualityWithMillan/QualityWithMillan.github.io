First of all **Thank you** for takinig your time or author /co-author a post with me.

You can follow these simple instructions to share a post for review:

> If you have no clue how to write post here are all that I have [published](https://github.com/QualityWithMillan/qualitywithmillan.github.io/tree/prod/_posts)
> This has got some example on how you can add hero/baner image etc..
>   If you decide to add a an image, make sure you upload that under `\assets\images\` folder 

### TL,DR


1. Create a markdown file (.md extension), before submitting :
    1. You may use any IDE preview your content, or
    2. Use one of the [Online Readme editor from google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+readme+editor)
2.  Make sure your post is submitted without `Data in file name` so it should look something like `my-first-blog.md`
    1. Once its reviewed, I will add a date in front of it like this `2021-09-09-my-first-blog.md` and it will be publised right away.
3.  Adding a category
  1. Make sure to pick one of the categories (you can add a your own/new category if none of thsese suits your work) `blog, post, tutorial, adventure, travel` etc.. 
  2. You can also add tags, these can be as many as you like, ideally 3-5 is best


I will imporve this document as I get feedback from you.


Once again thank you for your time to share knowledge with community for free.
