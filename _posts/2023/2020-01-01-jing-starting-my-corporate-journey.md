Around seven months ago, I officially farewelled [University of New South Wales, Australia 🇦🇺](https://www.unsw.edu.au/homepage/)  (`UNSW`) and concluded my chapter as an _undergraduate university student_. 
  Despite being a relatively fresh graduate, I actually started **my corporate journey two years ago**, and I have to admit, I genuinely have not missed a single day of learning experiences at University.

  And in this blog, I would like to share some of my __personal experiences__ on how I found my way to the corporate working world. 🙌🏼 in simple 3 sections :


1. [How I secured my internship](#how-i-secured-my-internship)

2. [Looking back on my internship experiences](#looking-back-on-my-internship-experiences)

3. [What’s next](#what-s-next)


## How I secured my internship

**How I secured my internship/graduate opportunities**

**Landing the first job wasn’t easy at all**, it took a lot of work. Some might disagree, but speaking from personal experience, working hard does not directly translate into opportunities, timing and luck often plays an equally important role if not more.

> Winding back a few years in time, I was an average uni-student who was satisfied with my situation, turning up on campus, getting assignments done, somewhat absorbing knowledge from completing courses one after another and was led to believe that I have a bright future ahead of myself. Little did I know that many colleague uni-students attending the same courses were already at least one or two internships into their professional careers. By the time I found out, I was already at a significant disadvantage.

Being aware of the situation, I started my internship searching journey. I was mainly looking for opportunities in two ways, the career opportunities tab under the company's website and job searching platforms. You might be wondering, why didn’t I opt for the university-offered co-op program. __Unfortunately, these programs typically have a required course mark in order to apply__ and I’m simply not the typical straight-A student that they are looking for..

To compensate for the above, **I was sending out dozens of resumes and cover letters on a weekly basis and hoped that the number of applications can give me an ever slightly better chance at landing an internship**. But sadly not only didn’t I receive little to no interview opportunities, but I was also completely disappointed by the overwhelmingly low percentage of responses that I was receiving, even if it was a rejecting notice. 

Rejections after rejections was definitely depressing, but most importantly it reminded me to alter my internship searching strategy. Instead of mass applying with relatively low preparation and effort, I started to reduce the number of application that I was sending. Which allowed me to spend more time on orgnisation specific research and cover letter modifications. And my approach of deciding what opportunities were worth taking forward was simple, if it seems too good be true, then it is sadly not feasible for me. I restricted my search scope to only focus on organisation with relatively smaller team size and less formal and structured recruiting process, as I believe it will give me a better shot of proceeding further on my internship journey.

Simultaneously, **I was also trying to become a more valuable intern candidate in my own right**. I began by committing time outside of study to work on side projects that allows me build on my existing knowledge and slowly moved towards expanding skill set by taking online courses as well as cracking online coding questions.

While the changes did not bring me overnight differences, I was confident that I was moving along the right path. Slowly but surely, not only my applications getting noticed, interview invites also started to come through. After booming a few invites due to my lack of interviewing experiences, I was able to quickly study from my mistake and ultmateily secured my first ever professional internship as a full-stacked web developer at a start-up company. Despite the nature of the internship being an un-paid offer, **I was extremely happy and grateful for the opportunity** I was given. I went on worked for the start-up for six month with my head down learning as much and I can before quitting due to the overwhelming amount of work from both the internship and University. But the experiences I was able to gained though securing the first internship combined with the technical skills I acquired in the role itself helped me quickly secured another intern opportunities at a bigger organisation shorter after.

Generally speaking, I believe **it’s the mind set of not giving up and study from mistake helped me in placing the first few footstep in my career journey**. And it is crucial to to acknowlege that luck was also a key factor during your recruitment processes, sometimes you’ll find recruiters that had similar experiences with you and are able to see the potential in you, sometimes you’ll find companies that have certain values out-weighting your personal skills, drawing meaningful conclusion out of the these interviews regardless of their outcome should always be the priority.

## Looking back on my internship

**Looking back on my internship/graduate experiences**

Over the last two years, I have been a part of two internships and one graduate offer in different organisation, and as you can maybe imagine, the experiences of working in various companies with different scale are largely diversed.

Starting with start-up businesses, due to the small team size nature, there are relatively small amount of artefact and routines I need to familiarise myself with and as a result, I was put into battle shortly after I was onboarded.  

On the other hand, orgnisation with decent size are much more structured. 

Generally speak, working in these companies are both incredibtly beneficial to people who are in still in their early phases of career like myself, as long as the right mindset is adopted


- Have vastly different internship experiences when working in different company

#### Startup
    - Lot more hands-on in a much shorter time span In a startup
    - Learning fast in the hard and dirty way
    - Playing multiple different roles in the company due to the size of the team

#### A bigger organization 
    - Much more structured onboarding and picked up technical tasks as progressively 
    - I was well taken care of by the team

#### Learning Outcomes of Internships
    - Make use of the opportunity to learn as much as you can (use the environment, take advantage of the experienced surrounding devs)
    - Don’t hesitate to seek help, no question is stupid, people have low expectations anyways(idk)?
    - Make connections
