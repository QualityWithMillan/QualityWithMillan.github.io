## The paradigm of Quality - Built-In

In our previous article, "[The paradigm of Quality](/post/the-paradigm-of-quality.html)" and "[The paradigm of Quality - Embedded](/post/the-paradigm-of-quality-embedded.html)", we discussed different maturity models and why organizations may require an independent model of Quality Engineering. In this article, we will examine various aspects of Quality Engineering in an built-in model.

In today’s fast-paced digital world, businesses are under immense pressure to release high-quality products at lightning speed. The traditional process of developing software has been replaced by a more efficient approach called DevOps. However, even with the integration of DevOps practices like Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, ensuring quality remains a major concern.

This is where Quality Engineering comes into play. Quality Engineering is the practice of ensuring that software products meet predefined quality standards throughout the development process. It takes a proactive approach to identify potential issues early in the software development lifecycle, making it an essential part of the DevOps culture.

The goal of this article is to take a comprehensive look at how we can built-in Quality Engineering in the development process and its role in the DevOps culture. 

By the end of this article, you’ll have a better understanding of Quality Engineering and its importance in delivering successful products quickly and efficiently. Let's dive in!

## What is DevOps?

As someone who's passionate about software development, I wanted to share my thoughts on DevOps.

DevOps culture refers to a set of practices, principles, and values which emphasizes the collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. It is a software development approach that aims to automate the software delivery chain while improving the quality of products and services provided by an organization. DevOps culture emphasizes continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), monitoring, testing, and analytics. By putting these principles into practice, organizations can achieve faster time-to-market, increased efficiency, better customer experience, and reduced costs. In this article, we will explore the importance of DevOps culture in modern software development and how it can help organizations achieve their goals efficiently.

In my view, DevOps is all about breaking down the barriers between development teams and IT operations teams, and promoting collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility. By working together more closely, these teams can deliver software and services faster and with fewer errors.

Of course, DevOps is not just a set of tools; it's also a cultural shift that requires organizations to adopt a mindset of continuous improvement and learning. With DevOps, organizations can automate processes, test early and often, and prioritize feedback and iteration.

In today's fast-paced, digital world, DevOps has become increasingly important. By enabling organizations to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs, DevOps can help companies stay competitive and continuously improve their products and services.

That's just my take on DevOps, but I hope it helps you understand this exciting and rapidly-evolving field a bit better.
