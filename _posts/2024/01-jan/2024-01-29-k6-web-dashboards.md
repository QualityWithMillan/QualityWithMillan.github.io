> Imagine running a test and having the ability to visualize and monitor its results in real-time. That's exactly what the k6 web dashboard offers. As your test progresses, the dashboard provides a dynamic overview of the performance metrics observed by k6. This real-time feedback can be a game-changer, allowing you to identify and address potential reliability issues as they occur.

### K6

`k6' is an open-source load testing tool that makes performance testing easy and productive for engineering teams. k6 is free, developer-centric, and extensible. Read more at [what is k6](https://k6.io/docs/#what-is-k6)?

**Use cases of K6**
k6 users are typically Developers, QA Engineers, SDETs, and SREs. They use k6 for testing the performance and reliability of APIs, microservices, and websites. Common k6 use cases are:

- Load testing
- Browser testing
- Chaos and resilience testing
- Performance and synthetic monitoring

But this blog post is not related to that. **It is dedicated to the latest cool k6 feature** in release [v0.49.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.49.0). 

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Free - real time web dashboards üìä for performance monitoring with an option to save results as HTML report.


### What's New! in release `v0.49.0`

`k6` continues to stand out with its latest feature ‚Äì a built-in web dashboard that takes real-time monitoring to a whole new level.

Let's jump straight to it.

`set K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true` and then your k6 command, lets say `k6 run script.js` 

**Usual run results on command line**

#### Web (HTML) Dashboards

There are mainly 3 tabs:

**1. Overview**

**2. Timings**

**3. Summary**

This one is very close to what the `json` report result would usually look like

### Configurable port for web dashbord

By default, the web dashboard is accessible on localhost port `5665`. 

!["Image showing port 5665 used as default for k6 web dashboards"](/assets/images/2024/01/01_port.png){: .align-center}

However, k6 is flexible, and you can customize the host and port according to your preferences. 
using `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_PORT`	you can use your choice of port number to bind the web dashboard to.

-----


### HTML repport

This adaptability extends to features like `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_EXPORT`. 
You can use that by specifying a filename to automatically export the `HTML test report` at the end of the test run.

> It's worth noting that the default value is empty, meaning the report isn't exported unless configured otherwise.

for example `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_EXPORT=html-report.html k6 run script.js`

So enabling the web dashboard with `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true`. Simultaneously, specifying the export feature with `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_EXPORT=html-report.html`, for HTML test report generation at the end of the test run.
