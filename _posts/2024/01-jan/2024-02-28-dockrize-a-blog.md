> Dockerizing my blog running on Ruby Gem üíé and Jekyll has proven to be a game-changer. In this short blog, I'll share how straightforward the process was, the benefits of Dockerization, and the convenience it offers for making changes and running the blog locally.

### No crap, straight to code first

Dockerizing a Jekyll blog involves creating a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yaml` file. 
These files encapsulate the environment and dependencies needed to run the blog on your local machine or on cloud seamlessly.

# `Dockerfile`

<hr>

```bash
# Use the official Jekyll image
FROM jekyll/jekyll:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /srv/jekyll

# Copy the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to the container
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./

# Install Jekyll and dependencies
RUN bundle install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Expose the default Jekyll port
EXPOSE 4000

# Command to run the Jekyll server
CMD ["jekyll", "serve", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
```


# `docker-compose.yaml`

<hr>


```bash
version: '3'
services:
  jekyll:
    image: qwm
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    volumes:
      - "./:/srv/jekyll"
    command: ["bundle", "exec", "jekyll", "serve",  "--force_polling" , "--host", "0.0.0.0"]

```


<hr>


### Running Locally:

With the `Dockerfiles` and `docker-compose.yaml` in place, running the Jekyll blog locally becomes a breeze. 
Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
$ docker-compose build

# Run the Jekyll server locally
$ docker-compose up
```
<hr>

This will initiate the Jekyll server, and you can access your blog locally at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)


### Benefits of Dockerization

1. **Isolation:** Docker encapsulates the blog and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments

2. **Portability:** The Dockerized setup is easily transferable, making it convenient to share with collaborators ( linux / mac / windows).

3. **Ease of Development:** Making changes and testing locally becomes seamless with the ability to run the blog in a controlled Docker environment.

**Wait ....You may ask Why, why Dockerize ?**

Q. Why Dockerize a Blog?

**Dockerizing my Jekyll blog was a game-changer for me!** 
> It's all about creating a smoother experience. Regardless of my setup, I can dive into my blog hassle-free ( local, cloud..). 


Q. How Does Docker Benefit Blog Development?


**Docker brings a level of consistency**
> ..and ease to blog development that I find invaluable. It's not just about the code; it's about creating an environment effortlessly and the benefits extend beyond my own work.

Q. Can I Still Make Changes Locally?

**Absolutely!**
 > Dockerization is designed to enhance, not limit, the development process. I'm just as passionate about the hands-on, creative aspect of blogging as you are. With Docker, making changes locally becomes a joy. You can tweak, experiment, and see your ideas come to life in real-time.


It's my way of extending an invitation to the community to explore and collaborate, creating a more accessible space for sharing insights and ideas. ü§óü§óü§ó
