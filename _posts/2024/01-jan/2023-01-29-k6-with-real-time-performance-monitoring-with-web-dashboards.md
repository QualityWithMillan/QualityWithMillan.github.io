> Imagine running a test and having the ability to visualize and monitor its results in real-time. That's exactly what the k6 web dashboard offers. As your test progresses, the dashboard provides a dynamic overview of the performance metrics observed by k6. This real-time feedback can be a game-changer, allowing you to identify and address potential reliability issues as they occur.

### K6

`k6` is an open-source project and ecosystem of related software, designed to facilitate UI automation of many app platforms, including mobile (iOS, Android, Tizen), browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), desktop (macOS, Windows), TV (Roku, tvOS, Android TV, Samsung), and more! ref - [appium.io](https://appium.io)



### What's New!

`k6` continues to stand out with its latest feature ‚Äì a built-in web dashboard that takes real-time monitoring to a whole new level.

Let's jump straight to it.

`set K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true` and then your k6 command, lets say `k6 run script.js` 

**Usual run results on command line**

#### Web (HTML) Dashboards

There are mainly 3 tabs:

**1. Overview**

**2. Timings**

**3. Summary**

This one is very close to what the `json` report result would usually look like

### Configurable port for web dashbord

By default, the web dashboard is accessible on localhost port `5665`. 

!["Image showing port 5665 used as default for k6 web dashboards"](/assets/images/2024/01/01_port.png){: .align-center}

However, k6 is flexible, and you can customize the host and port according to your preferences. 
using `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_PORT`	you can use your choice of port number to bind the web dashboard to.

-----


### HTML repport

This adaptability extends to features like `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_EXPORT`. 
You can use that by specifying a filename to automatically export the `HTML test report` at the end of the test run.

> It's worth noting that the default value is empty, meaning the report isn't exported unless configured otherwise.

for example `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_EXPORT=html-report.html k6 run script.js`

So enabling the web dashboard with `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true`. Simultaneously, specifying the export feature with `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_EXPORT=html-report.html`, for HTML test report generation at the end of the test run.
